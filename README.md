# godot-kotlin-project-template

This is the directory structure and build scripts for the standard Godot/Kotlin project.

These should be placed under your Godot project's root directory:
```
<Godot Project>/
- project.godot
- kotlin/ <- This is the directory that contains the contents of this repository
```

Each release of this repository contains a zip of this repository called: `kotlin_template.zip` which contains everything in here, minus this `README.md`, and inside of a directory: `kotlin/`.
